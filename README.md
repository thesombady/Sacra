# Sacra
A Game Engine built untop of Exodus Game Engine. It's based on Tkinter and selfmade packages, which include vector definitions and meshes definitions. Sacra is built as a free-time project and thus it might be updated infrequently however it is open-source.

Follow the roadmap at <https://trello.com/b/xGyzR9IJ/exodus-game-engine>.


# Usage
As of yet there is no usage, later on you'll be able to use the UI which is under construction.
```bash
python Program.py
```


# Contribute
Given this is open-source feel free to propose changes and/or contribute by your own. If you want to contribute to my PayPal to keep this project as up to date as possible, feel free to toss a coin to "https://www.paypal.me/aristotes".

# Disclaimer
Due to lack of time, from my end, the project is set on hold. As my profile states, I'm a student, not of computer science so this is purely on my freetime. I'll pickup where things need to be done, but only when the opportunity arises.
