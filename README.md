# Sacra
A Game Engine built untop of Exodus Game Engine. It's based on Tkinter and selfmade packages, which include vector definitions and meshes definitions. Sacra is built as a free-time project and thus it might be updated infrequently however it is open-source.

Follow the roadmap at (https://trello.com/b/xGyzR9IJ/exodus-game-engine).
